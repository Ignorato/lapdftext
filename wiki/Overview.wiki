#summary System Overview

= Introduction =

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is the almost universally used file
format for online scientific publications. It is also difficult to read and handle computationally, presenting challenges for developers of biomedical text mining or biocuration informatics systems that use the published literature as an information source. To facilitate the effective use of scientific literature in such systems we introduce Layout-Aware PDF Text Extraction (LA-PDFText). 


= Details =

LA-PDFText (Layout Aware PDF to Text Extractor) is a free software meant for use by researchers in the biomedical informatics and biomedical NLP communities. This system allows the user to extract text from PDF files of scientific articles in a layout and section aware manner.  


= How Does it work? =
The figure below shows the steps that LA-PDFText goes through to 
extract text from the PDF files.

The current version of LA=PDFText is a baseline system that extracts text using a three-stage process: (1) identification of chunks of contiguous text (2) classification of these chunks into rhetorical categories (3) extraction of the text from section-wise grouped text chunks.


= Installation Instructions =

The current version of LA-PDFText requires Java 1.6 in order to run and supports the following operating systems: 
  # MacOSX Snow Leapoard 10.6.7  [download http://code.google.com/p/lapdftext/downloads/detail?name=InstallLA-PDFText-1.0-Mac.zip&can=2&q=]
  # Windows XP
  # Linux
