#summary System Overview

= Introduction =

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is the almost universally used file
format for online scientific publications. It is also difficult to read and handle computationally, presenting challenges for developers of biomedical text mining or biocuration informatics systems that use the published literature as an information source. To facilitate the effective use of scientific literature in such systems we introduce Layout-Aware PDF Text Extraction (LA-PDFText). LA-PDFText (Layout Aware PDF to Text Extractor) is a free software meant for use by researchers in the biomedical informatics and biomedical NLP communities. This system allows the user to extract text from PDF files of scientific articles in a layout and section aware manner.  


= How Does it work? =
The figure below shows the steps that LA-PDFText goes through to 
extract text from the PDF files.

The current version of LA=PDFText is a baseline system that extracts text using a three-stage process: (1) identification of chunks of contiguous text (2) classification of these chunks into rhetorical categories (3) extraction of the text from section-wise grouped text chunks.



= Installation Instructions =

The current version of LA-PDFText requires Java 1.6 in order to run and supports the following operating systems: 
  # MacOSX Snow Leapoard 10.6.7
  # Windows XP
  # Linux

Choose the installer meant for your operating system download it. Mac and windows users can run their installers by simply double-clicking the installer icon while Linux users can run the installer usig the command {{{java -jar <installername>}}}. The installer will take you through the steps and will ask you where you want the LA-PDFText application to be installed. The target directory where you choose to install the application will contain a folder called {{{sampleData}}}. This folder contains 2 sub-folders one with sample PDF files from the journal PLoS Biology and one with the output generated by LA-PDFText running on these PDF files. The rule files used for the block classification stage are provided under a folder called {{{rules/plos/}}}. 


= Usage =

Once installed you can run LA-PDFText in 2 modes: (1) as an application with a UI (2) as a command-line tool. The table below summarizes these capabilities across the three platforms.

||         || UI || cmdLine ||
||MacOSX   ||yes || yes     ||
||WindowsXP||yes || no      ||
||Linux    ||yes || yes     ||
