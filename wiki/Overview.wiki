The target directory where you choose to install the application will contain a folder called {{{sampleData}}}. This folder contains 2 sub-folders one with sample PDF files from the journal PLoS Biology and one with the output generated by LA-PDFText running on these PDF files. The rule files used for the block classification stage are provided under a folder called {{{rules/plos/}}}. 

== WARNING: ==
The current version of all the installers will mark the {{{sampleData}}} as read-only. So DO NOT use that directory as an output directory to hold the results of your LA-PDFtext run. [http://code.google.com/p/lapdftext/issues/detail?id=1]
